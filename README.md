# :wave: Greetings from Spain
This is **Kevin** a human who likes to work with computers and people. **Software Engineer** by craft, **Wannabe Writer** by heart. I contribute with my own-made **Open Source** projects and write about stuff that I find _cool_ from time-to-time. Down below you will find the projects that I'm actively working on, along a schedule table which helps me to keep myself on-track.

## :rocket: Active projects
- [trello-action] Easily automate the process of creating, moving, and deleting **Trello cards** by harnessing the power of **Github actions** to perform requests on the [trello-api] when **Issues** or **Pulls** get opened, reopened, labeled or closed.

## :package: Recent releases
- There aren't recent releases for the moment, but don't fret soon there will be!

## :calendar: Boxes of time
Boxes of time are periods where I focus exclusively on one task, this I have found to be a good method to get things done.

| From      | To        | Task                                  |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------- |

| 7:30AM    | 9:00AM    | `Trello Action / Writing / Other(s)`  |
| 11:30AM   | 13:30PM   | `Trello Action / Writing / Other(s)`  |
| 6:00PM    | 8:00PM    | `Trello Action / Writing / Other(s)`  |

**Rules**
- `Reading` time-box repeats from monday-to-friday
- `Trello Action` time-box repeats at morn and eve twice each week
- `Writing` time-box repeats twice each week
- `Other(s)` time-box repeats twice each week
