# :wave: Greetings from Spain
This is **Kevin** a human who likes to work with computers and people. **Software Engineer** by craft, **Wannabe Writer** by heart. I contribute with my own-made **Open Source** projects and write about stuff that I find _cool_ from time-to-time. Down below you will find the projects that I'm actively working on, along a schedule table which helps me to keep myself on-track.

## :rocket: Active projects
- [trello-action] Easily automate the process of creating, moving, and deleting **Trello cards** by harnessing the power of **Github actions** to perform requests on the [trello-api] when **Issues** or **Pulls** get opened, reopened, labeled or closed.

## :package: Recent releases
- There aren't recent releases for the moment, but don't fret soon there will be!
