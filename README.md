## ðŸ§° Tools
- [**golog:**](https://github.com/ksrof/golog) Logger library for `Golang` which works on top of the standard library logger. It gives a nicely color-coded output (when used alongisde a `TTY`) otherwise it can write the contents to a file in `JSON` format. **WIP**
- [**gocolors:**](https://github.com/ksrof/gocolors) Color library for `Golang` which works along the standard library `fmt` and `log` packages. It can render text in a wide variety of colors giving your programs a much more outstanding output. **WIP**

## ðŸ¤– Actions
- [**trello-action:**](https://github.com/ksrof/trello-action) Easily automate the process of creating, moving and deleting `Trello Cards`, use the power of `Github Actions` to perform requests on the `Trello API` when a new `Issue` or `Pull Request` gets made, updated, labeled or closed! **WIP**

## ðŸ‘¹ Katas
- [**gilded-rose-kata:**](https://github.com/ksrof/gilded-rose-kata) Gilded Rose refactoring kata made with `Golang`
