## Greetings from Spain! ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸

### What I'm working on?

- **[Golog](https://github.com/ksrof/golog)**
  - Golog is a logger library for Go (golang), which works on top of the standard library logger. It gives nicely color-coded output (when a terminal is used) otherwise it can write the contents to a file in JSON format.
- **[Gocolors](https://github.com/ksrof/gocolors)**
  - Gocolors is a color library for Go (golang), which works along the standard library fmt and log packages. It can render text in a wide variety of colors giving your programs a much more outstanding output.
