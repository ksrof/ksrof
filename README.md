## Greetings from Spain! ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸

### What I'm working on?

- **[Yummybook](https://github.com/ksrof/yummybook)**
  - Yummybook is a teeny-tiny webapp that allows you to create,    tag, and filter your own recipes, never lose time again searching the right meal on the internet, you'll have the preparation from start-to-finish at your disposal in a blink of an eye!

### What's currently on my toolbox?

- **Golang**
  - This is one of the languages that as of to day I find most enjoyable to work, I use it mainly for REST APIs, CLI and Network development. One of the things that really made me like this language it's the simplicity that sorrounds it, you can setup MYSQL inside a Docker container add a bit of HTML and bum, a webapp was successfully created!

- **Javascript**
  - Well this is, or was, a kind of love and hate relationship, don't get me wrong I just don't like the constant "new top-notch cutting-edge js framework release" so when it comes to this language I'm very careful when I choose with what technology I want to work with. Personally I really enjoy React and Node along Typescript because they allow me to get something working in little to no time.

- **HTML/CSS**
  - Where it all started for me, obviusly when I started developing with these two it was just that, plain and simple, now things have evolved and when I write HTML and CSS I'll normally do it using some tools like SASS, Flexbox, etc.. all of which if used properly can result in gorgeous webapps that a user may find really appealing.
